When I initialize a repository I find a subfolder in the parentfolder named .git in which there is all the information about the repository and the commits etc.
The staging area is where we create, make, change.. files but we don't necessarily save them and even if we do we don't necessarily add them/commit them to the repository. A working directory is just the folder with all the files in it.
